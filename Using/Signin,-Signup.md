* a new user can signup to the Bitnobi system simply by navigating to the Bitnobi home page (e.g. https://demo.bitnobi.com:3000) clicking on the "silhouette" icon in the upper right corner and selecting "Sign Up" from the menu. 
* a freshly "signed up" user initially has no access to Bitnobi functions and can only update their profile and change their password and not much more. A new user needs to contact the Bitnobi "admin" user for their organization to set the user attributes, create a policy that matches those user attributes and assign which resources that policy will activate. The new user will then need to sign in again to get access to assigned Bitnobi resources.
* you can open another tab on your browser and direct that to Bitnobi as well so that you can run 2 or more sessions. When you do so, the new tab will use the Bitnobi SessionID from your browser's cookies to automatically authenticate you without needing into signin again. If you signout of one of the tabs, the Bitnobi session ID becomes invalidated and you are signed out of all the tabs.
* the "Email"  entry in your profile is used exclusively by the "forgot password" function. If you go to the Signin page an press "forgot password" it will send a reset link to the email specified in the user's profile. Note that Bitnobi needs to be configured to access an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server like "Postfix" to perform this function.
